synopsis:
  short: >- 
    An insomniac director is endlessly browsing his video feed. Out of nowhere a magical video appears, claiming it can make one sleep instantly. \
     \
    One click starts an innocent surrender to deep meditation. Our hero has to figure out what matters to him the most. The dream inside the sleep, or the wake-up call inside life? 
  long: >-
    The world is spinning at a thousand miles an hour keeping us all awake. The hero’s journey starts while watching TV and stumbling upon a “magical” video claiming to make one sleep instantly. \
      \
    When playback begins, we are transported to a different plane of consciousness: a lounge in the park. What happens from here is only for the sleeper to sense and the viewer to ponder. \
      \
    Clarity is replaced by experience embodied by a mélange of dreamscape vignettes. They gradually bring us closer and closer to the hero’s psyche. \
      \
    Is he a restless kid who struggles to sleep? Or a delusional adult who struggles to dream? \
      \
    And what happens when the outside world needs us to wake up? What if our slumber infects those around us? \
      \
    The answer lies in true reflection. Of a shiny TV screen.
director_statement: >- 
  The beginning of _“This Will Make You Sleep Instantly”_ happened to myself during a night I couldn't sleep. I came across a video titled as such. My first reaction was “really?” \
   \
  The aggressive marketing, the commercialisation of a chronic problem like insomnia, the horrendous A.I. universe aesthetics and their endless repetition made me angry.  Pretty suspicious of a video that claims instant sleep and lasts 11 hours. \
   \
  These thoughts were vigorously painted on my stunned face while getting immersed in the flamboyant contents of the TV screen. \
   \
  The afterthought of those contradicting emotions gave birth to the "what if this video actually worked" idea. \
   \
  We all re-live our life when we wake up. Sleep is a transition. Some individuals experience every day as a micrography of life. Birth – life – death. \
   \
  In their daily ritual of taking their dying breath in bed at night, they reflect on their day through their memories and regrets. Optimists win the battle. They have a pulsating, quiet sense of adequacy. Pessimists lose it. They get insomnia, they get bitter. \
   \
  When the worlds of optimism and pessimism collide, they give birth to art. \
   \
  Art is the illegitimate child of love and reality. Art is going to solve all of the problems we never had. Art is cool.
